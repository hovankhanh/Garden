        Many people in the world do volunteer work. Each nation has a lot of people who voluntarily take care of others. Even though who you are and how much your age is……… you all do volunteer work. There are many volunteer works such as visiting old or sick people, teach poor children……… and so on, however, have you ever thought that why do people do volunteer work?
It is sure that there are many reasons for it.
In my opinion, there are five main reasons why people do volunteer work. The first reason, I think that it is humanity. People , who feel lucky and have a good life, share the feelings of the poor, the injured, the disables……….and so on. Thus, they want to share with them difficulties and sadness, give small helps to them which can help them overcome troubles. They want to bring happiness to poor and disabled children as well as boys who no longer have fathers and girls who no longer have mothers. They want to help these children be gone to school and teach them things which they usually learn from their parents. Besides, they take care of old and sick people because they consider them as their relatives and hope to help them pass over loneliness and sickness. They also want to their kids about humanity. They teach them to love and help others. Secondly, people do volunteer work because it is their interest in free time, perhaps.” Instead of listening to music or playing games….. we like to do volunteer works. It is really interesting and we can also help others.” Some people shared. Thirdly, some people do it because it is their work. These people usually work in voluntary organizations. They are paid for it. The fourth reason, people who not only want to help but they also train their ability in activities of society, do volunteer work. They think it can both help others and train themselves. They also find out friends or people who have sympathy with them. Finally, above all things, people do volunteer work because they think that the happiest people in the world are those who help to bring happiness to others. It is one of the most successes in their life.
In a word, volunteer work is a happiness, right?!

  Đây nhoa~ Tick mik nha~Many people in the world do volunteer work. Each nation has a lot of people who voluntarily take care of others. Even though who you are and how much your age is……… you all do volunteer work. There are many volunteer works such as visiting old or sick people, teach poor children……… and so on, however, have you ever thought that why do people do volunteer work?
It is sure that there are many reasons for it.
In my opinion, there are five main reasons why people do volunteer work. The first reason, I think that it is humanity. People , who feel lucky and have a good life, share the feelings of the poor, the injured, the disables……….and so on. Thus, they want to share with them difficulties and sadness, give small helps to them which can help them overcome troubles. They want to bring happiness to poor and disabled children as well as boys who no longer have fathers and girls who no longer have mothers. They want to help these children be gone to school and teach them things which they usually learn from their parents. Besides, they take care of old and sick people because they consider them as their relatives and hope to help them pass over loneliness and sickness. They also want to their kids about humanity. They teach them to love and help others. Secondly, people do volunteer work because it is their interest in free time, perhaps.” Instead of listening to music or playing games….. we like to do volunteer works. It is really interesting and we can also help others.” Some people shared. Thirdly, some people do it because it is their work. These people usually work in voluntary organizations. They are paid for it. The fourth reason, people who not only want to help but they also train their ability in activities of society, do volunteer work. They think it can both help others and train themselves. They also find out friends or people who have sympathy with them. Finally, above all things, people do volunteer work because they think that the happiest people in the world are those who help to bring happiness to others. It is one of the most successes in their life.
In a word, volunteer work is a happiness, right?!
